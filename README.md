# BetterBan

## Purpose
The Northstar Docker image recreates the R2Northstar folder on each startup, which contains banlist.txt. This mod essentially recreates and improves on the ability to ban players. This mod requires Karma's Admin Abuse mod as a dependency.

## Features
1. Customizable ban message
2. Ability to ban by UID even when players are not on the server

## Todo
- [ ] Allow for console to run these commands
- [ ] Publish to Thunderstore
